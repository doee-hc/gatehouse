# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/doee-hc/gatehouse/releases/tag/v0.2.1) - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Breaking:** rename **`gatehouse_bootstrap_tree`** → **`gatehouse_submit_orchestration`** — architect submits/validates `mission.script.ts` and kicks off orchestration; execution tree creation remains in `gatehouse_apply_skill_domains` when skill domains need manual assignment.
- **Autopilot replaces lead user-await** — toggle with TUI `/autopilot` or IM `/autopilot on|off`. When ON and `.gatehouse/lead/direction.yaml` is `status: confirmed`, Lead proceeds without asking after 10 minutes of user idle time. TUI sidebar shows autopilot + direction status.

### Added

- **Orchestration plan compile** — declarative plan compile/store with stall recovery; Portal orchestration timeline.
- **Direction & autopilot tooling** — `.gatehouse/lead/direction.yaml`, `gatehouse_direction_status`, autopilot wake/enabled prompts.
- **Skill verify/extract pipeline** — extract and verify agents with dedicated manifests.
- **Portal offline cache** — persist snapshot, blog, branding, team stats, and skill details to `.gatehouse/portal/cache`; hydrate portal shell from disk when backend is unreachable; throttled warm refresh (5min TTL, 2s debounce) with full blog markdown and skill bodies.
- **VPS static bundle** — export `bundle.json` alongside disk cache; `/offline-cache/bundle.json` fallback when Portal API is unreachable; embed in `dist` when building with `GATEHOUSE_PROJECT_DIR`.
- **Orchestration failure handling** — validate `orchestrate()` syntax before run; notify architect on sandbox startup errors; allow **`gatehouse_submit_orchestration`** retry after failure.

### Fixed

- Portal first visit resolves project slug from server disk cache when health and localStorage lack it.
- Blog cache refresh no longer crashes CI when the project directory is gone.

### Docs

- Refresh bilingual README and expand dev guides (Mission flow, offline cache, qq-onebot, bridge packages).

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/doee-hc/gatehouse/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **Mission execution: TeamSpec → orchestration script** — the biggest change in this release. Architect no longer describes the execution team as a standalone TeamSpec and relies on agents to assign work through `gatehouse_send_message`. Instead, each Mission is driven by `.gatehouse/trees/<mission_id>/mission.script.ts`: `export const team` defines the execution tree, and `export default async function orchestrate(ctx)` defines phase order. After `gatehouse_bootstrap_tree`, a sandbox orchestrator runs the script and **injects node briefs and work-order prompts** via `ctx.setBrief`, `ctx.prompt`, and `ctx.waitFor`. The platform owns timing and activation; inner agents start from orchestration-delivered prompts and read scope through `gatehouse_mission_info`. `gatehouse_send_message` is now for peer alignment and small in-flight corrections only — not the primary task-dispatch path.
- **IM channels merged into `@gatehouse/core`** — channel bridge logic now lives at `@gatehouse/core/channels` (`packages/core/src/channels/`).
- **OpenCode channels plugin** — `@gatehouse/core/channels/plugin` in project `opencode.jsonc`.
- **Docs** — unified IM guide: [docs/guide/channels.md](./docs/guide/channels.md) / [docs/guide/channels.zh.md](./docs/guide/channels.zh.md); installation docs list all synced agent files; [PUBLISH.md](./packages/core/docs/PUBLISH.md) recommends `bunx install` over `opencode plug`.

### Added

- **OpenCode 1.17.x support** — install and doctor accept OpenCode `>= 1.14.40` and `< 1.18.0`.

### Fixed

- **Local `.tgz` install** — `install ./gatehouse-core-*.tgz` now writes the TUI plugin as `file://…/src/tui/index.ts` instead of reusing the server package root; doctor recognizes archive-based TUI registrations.
- `**uninstall`** — removes all Gatehouse-synced agent definitions (`build-root`, `build-coordinator`, `build`, `build-root-solo`), not only the four outer agents.

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/doee-hc/gatehouse/releases/tag/v0.1.1) - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- `**install` TUI registration** — `bunx @gatehouse/core install` now writes `@gatehouse/core` to `~/.config/opencode/tui.json`, matching `opencode plug @gatehouse/core --global`. The previous `@gatehouse/core/tui` subpath spec is not resolved correctly by OpenCode's npm plugin loader, so the TUI sidebar and client guard did not load.
- `**doctor`** — treats `@gatehouse/core` in `tui.json` as a valid TUI plugin registration (still accepts the legacy `/tui` subpath for existing configs).

### Changed

- Installation docs now describe the OpenCode-native `tui.json` plugin spec (`@gatehouse/core` with `exports["./tui"]` resolution).

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/doee-hc/gatehouse/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2026-06-06

**Early preview release.** APIs, config layout, and agent prompts may change in patch or minor releases while the project is in `0.x`.

### Added

- `**@gatehouse/core`** — OpenCode server + TUI plugin with Lead / Architect / Curator / Arbiter outer team
- **Mission lifecycle** — queue, start, execution, retrospective, skill distillation, and completion
- **Registry & messaging** — SQLite-backed agent registry, scoped `gatehouse_send_message`, delivery queue, execution-tree watchdogs
- **Permission arbiter** — automated handling of OpenCode permission prompts via the Arbiter agent
- **Portal office UI** — pixel-art office view, blog publishing, and skill browser (bundled in core as `dist/portal/`)
- `**gatehouse` CLI** — `install`, `doctor`, and IM channel management commands
- **IM channels** — WeChat / Feishu / QQ routing, `/agent` switching, attachments (`@gatehouse/core/channels`)
- **Bundled IM bridges** — WeChat, Feishu, and QQ bridge sources copied into `@gatehouse/core` at build time
- **Bilingual templates** — English and Chinese `.gatehouse/` agent prompts and config scaffolding
- **Documentation** — README, Getting Started, and installation guides in English and Chinese

### Known limitations (0.1.0)

- **Not production-ready.** Treat this release as an early preview; behavior and on-disk formats may change.
- **TUI only.** The terminal TUI workflow is verified. OpenCode Desktop and IDE extensions are not yet tested.
- **OpenCode version range.** Requires OpenCode `>=1.14.40` and `<1.17.0` (see `@gatehouse/core` `engines.opencode`).
- **IM channels are optional.** Bridges support text and images (plus WeChat voice via CDN decrypt); file/video and some media types are not fully supported.
- **Portal is local-first.** Use `http://127.0.0.1:18471/` after starting the plugin; a standalone public Portal hub is planned but not shipped in this release.
- **Portal UI has no dedicated test suite.** Core integration tests cover Portal API snapshots and static serving; the Phaser frontend is not separately tested in CI.
- **npm scope setup required.** Publishers must create the `@gatehouse` npm organization before the first release (see [PUBLISH.md](./packages/core/docs/PUBLISH.md)).
